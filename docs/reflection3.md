## Design rules for motion
In the paper ‘Designing Robots With Movement in Mind’ by Hoffman & Ju [^1], an expressive movement centered approach is explored in the context of robot design. According to Hoffman & Ju, the main focus of the design process should be on the quality and properties of movements. This means that the aesthetics of the robot is secondary to the motion. By focusing on movement, the internal state, personality, intention and mood of a robot can be conveyed.

The authors of the paper also encouraged the design of non-humanoid robots. This is due to the fact that if motion and movement is designed well, a designer does not have to focus on other expressive commodities: the well designed movement is enough. In addition, a designer has more freedom of exploration when they are not constrained by the human-form and therefore it leads to open-ended design possibilities. It also might help to reduce costs, a robot with less degrees of freedom is cheaper to produce and allows for more rapid prototyping. Lastly, a non-humanoid robot might lead to more acceptance. According to Hoffman & Ju, a more abstract robot allows for the user’s imagination without being constrained to pre-learned judgements.  

To create well designed motion, the authors explored four design challenges or steps: discovery, implementation, appearance-matching and validation.

-	Discovery: The right movements and motions for a robot should be explored or discovered. Collaboration with actors, dancers or animators might allow for valuable insight. In addition, prototype techniques such as Wizard of Ozzing or other participatory methods are most suitable for this step.
-	 Implementation: A mechanical system which allows for the discovered movements should be designed. The expressive movement of the robot is most important for this stage and because of this, Degrees of Freedom should be explored to allow for smooth and organic movements.
-	Matching form to movement: After the movement is defined, the form of the robot should be created in such a way that it supports the intended movements. The form of the robot can be explored via rapid prototypes tools or via the creation of physical mock-ups.
-	Validation: The robot should be evaluated on its purpose: does the robot achieve the envisioned purpose? 

This paper is highly relevant to our project work for this week for which we created a toolkit to explore the expression of a robot through movement and color. By focusing on non-verbal communication via a non-humanoid robot, we were able to explore the conveyed urgency of a robot.
