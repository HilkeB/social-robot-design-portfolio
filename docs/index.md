# About me
My name is Hilke and I am an Interaction Technology Master[^1] student at the University of Twente. During my Bachelor Creative Technology[^2] I learned how to combine broad knowlegde on electrical engineering, computer science and design to create meaningful, and technological, solutions to a problem.

During my Bachelor I also joined RoboTeam[^3], one of the student teams of the University of Twente, which creates autonomous footbal robots. During this year I was responsible for the electronics of the robots and because of this it should come as no suprise that I really like working with hardware!

The knowlegde which I gained during my Bachelor and my student team year are valuable skills which I can use during my master of Interaction Technology. During this master program I mainly follow courses about Human-computer interaction in addition to more technical courses.
