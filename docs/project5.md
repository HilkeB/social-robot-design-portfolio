During this week’s project meeting a case study was conducted to test the created toolkits. During the past weeks the prototypes created have already been tested. However, where possible, a more advanced prototype was created and used during the case study of this week. 

## Toolkit 1: A scenario-based toolkit

The first toolkit which was created for this course was a scenario based toolkit.

However, to test the toolkit in a physical and collaborative setting, three physcical dice were created:

## Toolkit 2: An expressive toolkit

The second toolkit was not itterative upon this week since it was already tesed in detail and it was not possible to gain access to a Sphero robot in time. Below, a video can be found which was recored during the fourth week of this course.

After a reflective conversation with the entire group, it was still possible to fill in the POEMS framework.

## Toolkit 3: An embodiment toolkit
After a digital visual prototype, a paper prototype was created to test the embodiment toolkit.
