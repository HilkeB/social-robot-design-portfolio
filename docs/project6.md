During this week's project session a behavior toolkit was created by my group and I (F. den Brok, S. Nanwani, D. Doeleman, R. den Otter, H. van den Born). The tool should preferrably not rely on a Wizard of Oz.

After a quick brainstorm we settled on the idea of character personlization of ROSE. When ROSE will be used in elderly care it should be able to communicate with a lot of different patients. Because of this we created five character types for ROSE (It was a struggle to get the sources correct in the images, because of this I will elaborte on our process after the presentation of the five different character profiles :) ) 

### ROSE the logician

### Inspiration for behavior toolkit
We were inspired by the 16 personality test in which a user can take a quiz and find out which personality type they are.
