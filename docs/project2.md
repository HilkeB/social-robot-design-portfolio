The aim of this week was to explore and create a story based design method. Carroll [^1] does a great job in describing the relevance and possibilities of scenario based design stating that it provides a flexible, reflective and layered method to explore possible design interactions. In addition, Carroll [^1] mentions that by abstracting scenarios, designers are able to find and recognize patterns and generalizations which in turn help a designer to address further challenges.

## Brainstorm methods
During the lecture my group and I [^2] explored several user centric design and research methods provided via the ‘User Innovation Toolbox’ [^3]. This exploration provided us with great insights in the currently available design methods and after reviewing all of them, we grouped them into categories. During this activity we identified several categories such as diary based methods, physical brainstorming methods and scenario based methods.

## Story Cubes
After the initial exploration of brainstorm methods we discussed which scenario based brainstorm methods we have used as a group and which ones we found most useful. The concept of story cubes was mentioned often and because of this, we decided to further investigate the technique. 

It was found that story cubes urge designers to create stories which are outside of their comfort zone. More often than not, a designer tends to create the perfect fitting story in which the product works well and has the intended effect. However, this approach does not allow for the critical exploration of a problem space and the creation of relevant and realistic prototypes. By utilizing story cubes, the designer does not have control over the main story line and therefore more scenarios can be explored [^4]. In addition to this, it was found that story cubes provide a collaborative way of story telling when done in a group. Lastly, it was stated by Bae et al. [^5] that the possible shaping and constraining character of story cubes can help to guide the scenarios, it can however also limit the creativity of a designer.

## Sotry Cubes and HRI
Even though story cubes can be considered a generalized brainstorm method, it can also serve as a very relevant brainstorm method in the context of HRI. This is caused by the fact that story cubes can be personalized to fit a certain context. To link the generalized concept of story cubes to HRI, the problem space of the ROSE robot as a co-amputee was further explored during one of the exercises of the lecture.

During this brainstorm several building blocks were found which were needed to create a robotic system that could function as a co-amputee. And with these building blocks in mind, several broader themes and applications can be identified: ROSE as mental support and ROSE as coach helping with tasks. This functioned as the basis for the creation of our story cubes.
