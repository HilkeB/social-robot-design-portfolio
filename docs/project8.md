During this week’s project meeting a case study was conducted to test the created behavior- and ethical toolkits. 

## Tookit 4: Behavioral toolkit
During the [sixth week](project6.md) of this course a behavioral toolkit was created by my group and I [^1]. To test this toolkit a total of five character sheets were physicalized by F. den Brok:

To test this toolkit we took inspiration from the theater style type of exploration as shown during multiple lectures. A total of three groupmembers part took in the role playing, the other two group members wathced and took on the role of observer and notetaker. The toolkit was tested during the following scenario:

- ROSE is a care robot which is being utilized in an elderly care home. In this elderly care home the patients need personalized care. A caregiver who nows the patients chooses the fitting personality type for ROSE and after this ROSE is ready to help the patients. 

Below a video of two of the runs can be found. The first patient was a grumpy old man who only wants to take ble pills. Unfortunately his pills are not blue. The caregiver selected the protector personality for ROSE since the paient needs clear communication and a firm hand. During the second scenario ROSE encounters an old lady who is roaming around the halls of the care home. Unsure how to get back to the living room she accepts the assistance of ROSE who is progammed as an empath.

### Insights after testing
The behavioural toolkit allowed us to explore the influence of different personalities of ROSE. The theater approach also allowed for fun and open ended exploration. It was concluded that the costumization of ROSE can be helpful to ensure that elderly patients feel safe and receive the care that they need. One this which we did not do during the case study is reviewing the same scenario with different personality types. Currently we only explored to personality types which we deemed to be the best fit to the scenario's. It would have been interesting to see how the scenario's would have played out when ROSE is programmed differently. 



## Tookit 5: Ethical toolkit
During the [seventh week](project7.md) an ethical toolkit was created by my group and I [^1]. This toolkit was also tested on 10-07-2025 in Design Lab. Two of my groupmemembers (D. Doeleman and R. Den Otter) prepared to content of the conversation. Just like the behavioural toolkit, this toolkit was also tested via role playing. The two earlier mentioned groupmembers play Pepper who showed videos on his tables. R. Den Otter created a scenario in which Pepper had the role of mediator while D. Doeleman created a scenario in which Pepper presented himself as a sentient being.

### Insights after testing
This toolkit provided a really fun and interesting conversation. A clear difference was found between Pepper as a mediator and Pepper presented as a sentient being. During the round in which Pepper functioned more as a mediator the benefit of using Pepper was the novelty and the utlization of the screen of Pepper. However, during the round in which Pepper functioned as a sentient being slightly more interesting results were found. When Pepper asked personal questions such as: 'Do I have the right to privacy?', 'Why can people just beat me up?' and 'Am I just a tool for you guys?' the group had a hard time awnsering these questions. The group felt a sense of compassion and sometimes akwardness, not sure how to express their believes that Pepper is a mere machine instead of a sentient being.

The exploration of Pepper as a sentient being provided an ethical enrichemnt. The almost absurdness of discussion ethics with a machine pretending to have feelings, and also believing it, helped to explore the akwardness of robot ethics. In addition to this, it showed themes from different perspectives. Themes such as sustainability ('Will you just throw me away after I am broken?'), robots in health care ('Do you think I am capable of providing emotional support to someone? can I cry with them? Be happy for them?') or societal issues (Why do you use my body to harm others?) can be meaningfully explored in an out of the box way!

The utlization of Pepper as a sentient being reminded me of the cases of robot anthropomophism which were discussed during the lectures. I already elaborated upon this during the [reflection](reflection7.md) which I added during week 7. The uneasiness with robot mishandling which was identified by Anthis et al. [^3] could be clearly seen during this casestudy. The presentation of Pepper as a sentient being and the reaction of the people partaking in the discussion was also not fully unexpected. Earlier in this course we discussed the emotional bond between people and their robotic pet [^4]. People are able to create strong bonds with robots (reminds me of the movie HER on which I reflected in the reflection of [week 1](reflection1.md)) and the exploration of this bond in combination with ethics proved to be succesfull!
